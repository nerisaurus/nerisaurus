## 𐂀 Hi
I'm a software developer solving problems and creating bugs at [Saga Education](https://saga.org/).  I try to make things easier for people, especially when they're working on great projects (including when that great project is themselves - _ad similitudinem Dei_).
<!--
I also like comments.  Not this one especially - this is just an easter egg - but comments, documentation pages, and forests of diagrams are great.  They may sometimes decay, and good code should be readable by its own nature... but there is value in being able to understand something enough to explain it in writing, and the decay itself can reveal what's misunderstood or drifted (and can itself be fixed, like all the rest of the atrophy around it).
